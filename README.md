Show CS gym activity as heatmap. Vue, Express, Puppeteer.

## Project setup

Run the following command on terminal
```
npm install
```
Node version 16.19.x or better is required. It's highly recommended to use Node 16.20.2 for the project (latest and last Node 16 version). Node 17 and later versions are not officially supported in Vue 2.7.16 and may cause issues if used in project.

Might change this once I migrate Vue2 to Vue3. But as of now I'm too lazy so just use Node 16 ty :)

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
For frontend, run the following command
```
npm run serve
```
For backend, run the following command
```
npm run watch
```
Backend is using nodemon for monitoring changes in code. It will automatically restart server if changes are detected. So don't worry about it

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```
